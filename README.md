# Analyzing Rape Cases in Rajasthan (2018–2022)
Exploratory Data Analysis using Python to uncover patterns, trends, and insights in rape cases reported across Rajasthan from 2018 to 2022.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on publicly available crime data from Rajasthan, specifically focusing on rape cases. The analysis aims to:
Identify year-over-year trends. Detect high-case districts. Measure case concentration gaps. Offer policy-focused suggestions. This project demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, time-series trend analysis, geospatial insights, and visualization using Python tools.

## Dataset Used
Source: 
- <a href = "https://github.com/alina-khan-1/Python-Project-Rajasthan-Rape-Cases/blob/main/Rajasthan_rape_district.csv">Rajasthan Rape District</a>
- <a href = "https://github.com/alina-khan-1/Python-Project-Rajasthan-Rape-Cases/blob/main/Rajasthan_rape_yearly.csv">Rajasthan Rape Yearly</a>
- Format: CSV
- Columns Include: Year, District, Number of Cases

## Tools & Technologies
- **Environment:** Visual Studio Code
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries Used:**
  - Pandas (data manipulation)
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)
  - NumPy (numerical operations)

## Key Questions Addressed
- Which districts are most affected in 2022?
- Is the trend increasing or decreasing over time?
- Is there a large gap between the top districts and the rest?
- What interventions might help reduce cases in the future?

## Process Followed
**1. Environment Setup** Installed Python and required libraries
- Configured VS Code with Jupyter for better interactivity

**2. Data Loading & Cleaning**
- Loaded the dataset using pandas.read_csv()
- Cleaned missing or inconsistent values
- Checked for data types and summary stats

**3. Visualization & Insights**
- Visualized the dataset using line graphs, bar plots, and heatmaps to discover trends and compare district-wise cases.

## Project Insights
**1. Yearly Trend in Rape Cases (2018–2022)**
- 2018: 4,335 cases
- 2019: ~5,900 (significant jump)
- 2020: drop in cases (likely due to COVID lockdown)
- 2021: highest with over 6,300
- 2022: slight decline
- **Insight:** There’s no clear upward or downward trend, but the post-2019 numbers remain high. Indicates a persistent problem despite fluctuations.

**2. District-wise Cases in 2022**
- Top Affected Districts:
- Bhilwara – 301 cases
- Bharatpur – high
- Udaipur – high
- Ajmer – 206 cases
- **Insight:** Bhilwara alone reports nearly 100 more cases than Ajmer. These districts require focused interventions.

**3. Comparison Among Districts**
- **Insight:** The gap between the top 5 districts and others is substantial, suggesting a highly uneven distribution. Some areas are much more affected than others.

## 4. Policy Suggestions
Based on insights, the following policy interventions are suggested:
- High-priority focus on Bhilwara, Bharatpur, and Udaipur
- Run awareness campaigns and training in high-incidence zones
- Implement fast-track courts for quicker resolution
- Introduce a yearly/monthly monitoring dashboard for real-time tracking

## Final Conclusion
The analysis reveals that rape cases in Rajasthan remain alarmingly high post-2019, with certain districts contributing disproportionately. While 2020 saw a drop, likely due to lockdowns, the issue returned with greater intensity in 2021.

- To address this:
  - Focus resources on top-affected districts
  - Introduce long-term preventive strategies
  - Monitor progress via data dashboards and year-over-year metrics

## What I Learned
- How to conduct meaningful EDA on social issues
- Gained experience in district-wise comparison and time-series trends
- Improved skills in drawing insights for policy recommendations
