# Analyzing Rape Cases in Rajasthan (2018–2022)
Exploratory Data Analysis using Python to uncover patterns, trends, and insights in rape cases reported across Rajasthan from 2018 to 2022.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on publicly available crime data from Rajasthan, specifically focusing on rape cases. The analysis aims to:
Identify year-over-year trends. Detect high-case districts. Measure case concentration gaps. Offer policy-focused suggestions. This project demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, time-series trend analysis, geospatial insights, and visualization using Python tools.

Format: CSV

Columns Include: Year, District, Number of Cases

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Environment: Visual Studio Code

Languages: Python

Libraries Used:

Pandas (data manipulation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)

NumPy (numerical operations)

🔍 Key Questions Addressed
Which districts are most affected in 2022?

Is the trend increasing or decreasing over time?

Is there a large gap between the top districts and the rest?

What interventions might help reduce cases in future?

📈 Process Followed
1. Environment Setup
Installed Python and required libraries

Configured VS Code with Jupyter for better interactivity

2. Data Loading & Cleaning
Loaded the dataset using pandas.read_csv()

Cleaned missing or inconsistent values

Checked for data types and summary stats

3. Visualization & Insights
Visualized the dataset using line graphs, bar plots, and heatmaps to discover trends and compare district-wise cases.

📊 Project Insights
📌 1. Yearly Trend in Rape Cases (2018–2022)
2018: 4,335 cases

2019: ~5,900 (significant jump)

2020: drop in cases (likely due to COVID lockdown)

2021: highest with over 6,300

2022: slight decline

📌 Insight: There’s no clear upward or downward trend, but the post-2019 numbers remain high. Indicates a persistent problem despite fluctuations.

📌 2. District-wise Cases in 2022
Top Affected Districts:

Bhilwara – 301 cases

Bharatpur – high

Udaipur – high

Ajmer – 206 cases

📌 Insight: Bhilwara alone reports nearly 100 more cases than Ajmer. These districts require focused interventions.

📌 3. Comparison Among Districts
📌 Insight: The gap between top 5 districts and others is substantial, suggesting highly uneven distribution. Some areas are much more affected than others.

📌 4. Policy Suggestions
Based on insights, the following policy interventions are suggested:

🚨 High-priority focus on Bhilwara, Bharatpur, and Udaipur

📢 Run awareness campaigns and training in high-incidence zones

⚖️ Implement fast-track courts for quicker resolution

🧾 Introduce a yearly/monthly monitoring dashboard for real-time tracking

✅ Final Conclusion
The analysis reveals that rape cases in Rajasthan remain alarmingly high post-2019, with certain districts contributing disproportionately. While 2020 saw a drop, likely due to lockdowns, the issue returned with greater intensity in 2021.

To address this:

Focus resources on top-affected districts

Introduce long-term preventive strategies

Monitor progress via data dashboards and year-over-year metrics

🧠 What I Learned
How to conduct meaningful EDA on social issues

Gained experience in district-wise comparison and time-series trends

Improved skills in drawing insights for policy recommendations
